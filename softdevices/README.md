To upload firmware to a Crownstone, you will nead the softdevice from nordic.
We do not provide the softdevice in this repository though.

You can obtain the `s132_nrf52_2.0.0_softdevice.hex` file from the nordic nrf5x SDK11, downloadable at: http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/nRF5_SDK_v11.x.x/
